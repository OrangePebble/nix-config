# This file sets up 'sops' so that I'm able to commit and use encrypted secrets.
# I can't get the secrets during evaluation (so I'm not able to directly add them
#  to option), because then the secrets would be plain text in the store.
#  It's a bit hard to figure out why thats a bad idea, but here is what I got.
#  The nix store is world-readable, which means everyone with access to your
#  system can read it, be it other users or malicious attackers that were able to
#  get any remote access to your server.
#  Additionally, if you want to build a configuration then send it to another
#  machine, the build machine will have a copy of the secrets in their store.
#  I don't think this are important usecases for me, but I should probably
#  follow good convention, just in case.
# If I do want to try and use secrets during evaluation time, this issue seems
#  to have a decent solution using 'nix plugins':
#  https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix/issues/624
# I'm using sops with 'age', and while I technically could use ssh keys for this,
#  that would require my ssh keys not having a passphrase, so thats a no go.
#
# As age only has to be set up once and it would be complicated to do it
#  automatically with SSH passphrases, I do it manually.
# To do this first create a temporary copy of the private SSH key file:
#  `cp ~/.ssh/<file> /tmp/<file>`
# Then transform the the copy into a version without a passphrase:
#  `ssh-keygen -p -N "" -f /tmp/<file>`
# Then generate the age key:
#  `ssh-to-age -private-key -i /tmp/<file> > ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`
# And finally don't forget to delete the copy of the SSH key file:
#  `rm /tmp/<file>`
#
# To generate a public age key (to be added to '.sops.yaml'), run the following
#  with a target machine's public SSH key file:
#  `cat <filename>.pub | ssh-to-age'
#  Or the following:
#  `ssh-keyscan <target-hostname> | ssh-to-age'
#
# To update an encrypted file with new keys run:
#  'sops updatekeys <file>'
